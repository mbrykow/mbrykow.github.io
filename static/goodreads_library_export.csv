When it was announced that this would basically be the first book, but from Hawke's POV, I was a little disappointed. Now don't get me wrong, I love multiple POVs, especially in an enemies-to-lovers trope, however, I wanted this story to advance, not to go back. I don't think we needed a WHOLE book from Hawke's perspective, but I understand why it's the 5th book in the series. If we had it along with Poppy's POV in the first one, things wouldn't have been revealed when they should have been. Maybe if this was a novella between the first and second books? That way we still get his POV, the reveals when they're supposed to happen, and there's no break in the advancement of the plot. With all that said, I still enjoyed his POV, which is why this is rated pretty high. ",,,1,0
